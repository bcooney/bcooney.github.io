## Moving from an individual contributor to a manager has been something I've wanted to do for a long time. Now that I'm making that move, here are my notes on my own Transition Risk Assessment, as found in Michael Watkins' "The First 90 Days"

> “To transition effectively, first identify the risks you face as you move into your new role using the Transition Risk Assessment. Start by checking off the types of transitions you are experiencing using the middle column. Then, for each item you checked, assess how challenging you are finding that particular shift on a 1–10 scale, where 1 means very easy and 10 means very difficult. Total the numbers in the right-hand column to get your Transition Risk Index (up to 100). The index gives you a sense of the magnitude of the challenge and the specific dimensions of your overall transition on which you most need to focus.”

I'm moving from being the technical guy in a business environment to being the business guy in a technical environment. The risks are plenty, and are very different from when I was a solo contributor. Here's how I see my risks in this delicate transition. I hope to use this blog to reflect more on these risks as I move forward and grow into this position.

* Moving to a new industry or profession - 3/10
* Joining a new company - 0/10

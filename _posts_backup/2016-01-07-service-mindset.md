## *“To whom do we bow?”* - Sojun Mel Weitsman

---

Recently I read the text of [a speech made by Sojun Mel Weitsman](http://www.chzc.org/mel21.htm) back in 2002. When I read this speech, a lot of it made sense to me; typically many Buddhist sentiments do. But there were two specific points in this text, which he calls "Laws of Practice" that really caught me, because I found they near perfectly describe my attitude toward work, and more specifically my attitude toward **service**. Here they are, summarized:

#### First Law of Practice:
"If you want something, you will be disappointed."

#### Second Law of Practice:

"...you have to give. You have to present yourself as an offering. You have to offer yourself completely to what you’re doing. Then, unexpectedly, something may appear. But you can’t ask for it, and you can’t expect it."

Putting aside the rest of the speech, this is 100% how I define my attitude toward what I do. I've worked at my company for 10 years. Some of those experiencing have been difficult; some have been punishing. That's normal for any job. While I've always worked with great people, some have left wanting something different, others have demanded more, others have stayed and just burned out. What's more, amidst all of this, people in my personal life have always asked one question: *Why do you stay?*

I read Weitsman's words here and I see why I stay: I stay because I want to continue practicing giving. Since the first day I came to EF, I knew I had something to give, and I had no idea what I'd get in return. Years later, I've made my own job (twice) where there was none, taken over two teams, worked in three countries, made friends all around the world... I've been successful. Much more successful than I ever thought I would be when I was 26 and starting out. But that's just it: I did so without any expectation, and without any wants. Yes, I've asked for things, but more often than not, I got the things I wanted without asking.

This is work to me, and this must be service: to give yourself to your work, and to your customer, without any expectation for return. If you can practice that (to use Weitsman's word) without distraction, day-in and day-out, you will be successful.

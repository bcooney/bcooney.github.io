Hi, I'm Brendan. You can learn more about me from the below resources, I'm sure. I've spent 10 years working in International Education. I'm currently located in Shanghai, China. I speak intermediate Chinese, unless you want to talk about something very technical or specific. I'm passionate about writing, music, education, politics, technology, security, coffee, denim and am starting to learn to cook. I presently volunteer my project management skills the security group I Am The Calvary, as well as the progressive political group Grassroots Select.

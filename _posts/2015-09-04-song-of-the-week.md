This type of pop music isn't for everyone, I'll say that, and for most of my life it wasn't for me either. I usually lean to much heavier music. I moved to China in 2009, when Girls Generation's first single, "Gee," had just come out. The song was absolutely everywhere, and it was the first time I'd seen singing and dancing coordinated across 9 people. In the US, the dancers dance and the singer sings, and sometimes the singer dances too. Seeing 9 people dance and sing together, throughout the entire song, with nearly no repeated moves was jaw-dropping. I've been a fan of this group for the same reason I'm a fan of hardcore (the energy) and metal (the intracacy). 

"Green Light" is off GG's new album "Lionheart" which was released in August. The difference between this song and "Gee" is pretty huge. This song is a great continuation off a song they did in Japan called "Beep Beep." The guitars are a little bit Rick Springfield-via-Katy Perry, and the chorus is just a burst of energy. Since they lost a member, the group feels more balanced, which is controversial to say among Girls Generation fans. On this song, along with the others on "Lionheart," you get more of everyone, which ends up really working for the group.

There's a video of the 8 current members on a Korean show called ["Weekly Idol"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmPXL6aWr0) that really demonstrates what makes this group special, not only among pop groups in Korea, but among celebrities around the world. They are playful, funny and incredibly down-to-Earth, despite the fact that they are massively famous in Asia. It's hard for me to think of other celebrities at their level that seem as happy as this. I think this, along with the consistent growth of their music, is why I keep coming back to Girls Generation. I changed a lot from 2009 through today, and in a way, their music is very much the soundtrack to my life in China. Their songs have been played in every club and restaurant I've been to, and I've heard or seen them on TV and in every shopping mall. If I moved back to the US, I'd miss that -- there's something very Asian about being surrounded by "idols." 

Anyway, I'm rambling. Enjoy the song! I sure do.

## Each year I like to keep a list of the albums that really surprised and excited me. Here's my 2015 list, in no particular order.

---

**Baroness** / Purple - What keeps me coming back to this band is how, no matter what happens, they keep getting better. They almost died a few years ago, and lost a few members on account of the accident. That would be enough to break up any band, but these guys not only keep going, they keep *progressing.* Truly an inspiration, and their best album yet. Listening to *Purple,* I easily find myself repeatedly asking "This is Baroness?"

**Prurient** / Frozen Niagra Falls - There were several years where I really didn't get Prurient, and those earlier albums still don't do much for me. But this album really struck me. It's somber -- somehow destructive and really well put together at the same time. Every sound on here is part of the story, and it's a dark story indeed.

**Locrian** / Infinite Dissolution - The bass on this album sounds tremendous. I think mixing electronics into fast, heavy music usually sounds terrible, unless it's purely electronic, but these guys have found a place for it. The fuzzy, electronic baselines sound amazing on this against the natural sound of drums. This albums' big surprise was how much less electronic it was compared to previous work I'd heard from Locrian. A really nice surprise.

**High on Fire** / Luminiferous - Nothing to say here. Matt Pike's still got it.

**Bosse-de-Nage** / All Fours - What is going on with this vocalist? The lyrics are all statements, stories -- they barely match the rhythm of the music at most times. His voice is strained, barely even there at some points, which is usually not the case for metal. He's drowned out by the music, which is on-point, making him just an accessory to the chaos. He's barely swimming in it. Every song is fantastic in that with each listen I can barely remember where they are going to go. Always surprising. Nothing here sounds borrowed from anywhere else.

**Deafheaven** / New Bermuda - Yep, they had a new album. Yep, it was better than *Sunbather.* Yep, they are still controversial. Yep, they are still great.

**Girls Generation** / Lion Heart - Some may be surprised that K-Pop would make my list for 2015, but this album has made many subway rides surprisingly more tolerable. This is an enormous steps for this group, considering their previous music, while catchy, has been pretty by-the-book K-Pop. This comeback album makes big strides in songwriting, melody, style and overall maturity. Most K-Pop groups of this size don't survive losing such a well recognized member, but they somehow have pulled out their best album yet.  

**God Mother** / Maktbehov - Biggest surprise of the year. I had spent all year waiting to hear something that had everything I love about hardcore. And I finally found God Mother. This album just doesn't stop. And while it has a few parts that I think aren't really necessary, it's clear they don't care at all. That's what it's all about.

**Godspeed You! Black Emperor** / Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress - What do you need to know about GSYBE that you don't already know? They do everything well. Any album they release will be on the list.

**Destroyer** / Poison Season - A lot of aggressive, wild music on this list, so it only makes sense that there be at least one album on here that matches a 35 year old. This album really takes bands like The War on Drugs down a peg. It's classic, and surprisingly complex and beautiful. It's overwhelmingly nice sounding, even when the vocals are somewhat embellished and breathy. The Hold Steady used to have this, and I'm really glad to hear a Destroyer album sound this rich. It's the type of music that makes you want to sit down, close your eyes and bliss-out.

**The Weeknd** / Beauty Behind the Madness - Our Michael Jackson. This guy can do everything, and everything he touches comes out great. I'm a huge fan of this guy.

## Part 2 of my Transition Risk reflection, focussing on moving to a new profession.

---

Originally I had ranked this 3/10, mostly because I'm not really moving to a new industry -- I'm still inside the same company, still inside the same industry. The real risk that I'm running with this transition is this: I was a technical person in a room full of business people and now I'm a business person in a room full of technical people.

Rather than interface with other people who have the business insight that I have, I'm now directly leading, managing and training engineers who have significantly higher technical skills/knowledge than I have.

The risk as I see it is three-fold:

1. Getting lost myself

2. Losing the new team

3. Losing the old team

Therefore, the best counter to this risk is balance. I'll need to keep one eye on having an even spread of input and output.

The assumption people make about second level technical help is that it's *just* a help desk, or *just* a support team; that assumes they are equal to front line defense. With front line service teams, customer service is the foundation, but with second line it's the exception -- technical skill is the foundation. What the second line doesn't realize is that customer service is a show; it's a performance, in public, of activities that benefit the customer as much as it is a resolution of an issue.

The risks I have above only come because of the opportunity I have. I have an opportunity to create a highly effective, high-impact, enormously cross-functional and cross-business team. And that's something, despite the risks, that I'm really looking forward to.

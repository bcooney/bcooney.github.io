## Reflection on Powerpoint and presentations as documents rather than live performance.

---

I can't put my finger on exactly when, but over the course of my professional career, I've developed a deep dislike for Powerpoint. *Presentations-as-documents* to be more specific. Presentations are *live,* happening fluidly; the presenter or trainer must be able to respond to situations not just in voice and action but in content and material as well. By contract, documents are static; even with their transitions and animations, they are inflexible and rigid. You can make an object move, but only at these speeds and only on these paths, etc... How many times have I sat in a presentation and watched as someone clicked endlessly through all effects?

A presenter is presenting something -- an idea -- and the material, if great, can be a part of that story. The root of the word itself is fundamental: **present.** Happening right now. These PPT-heavy presentations never work because they aren't present. They are time capsules from before the presentation. They are on display and the presenter is just supporting the PPT. You can see this in full effect any time someone clicks and says "it wasn't supposed to do that."

On top of the inflexibility and lack of presence is that they are fundamentally a 'business' tool. There are no fun or exciting presentation documents. There are no elements of play which would help increase that feeling of immediacy.

Presentations as documents aren't sustainable -- because version control doesn't exist there is no growth. These documents are created and stay as they are, stunted; while other people may make changes and updates, the entire thing never evolves. People may make a new file, or copy parts of one into another, but that's just repeating history. No leap forward.

These presentation documents also have awful security. You don't actually own it. You can't control who can see it, where, in what way -- you can't own the experience of it. Presentations end up on USB drives and in emails and leave organizations; they are reused outside of the company over and over, or sold or stolen for use elsewhere.

Lastly, the final nail in this is storage -- there is no way that navigating through folders and folders of presentation files will ever be easier than navigating through a website. In my company we use DFS replication to sync hundreds of presentations with nearly 100 sites each week. A healthy DFS has an approximate 10% fail rate, but having 10% of our sites not receive their content each week is an unacceptable risk. There's no such thing as a 100% successful DFS. Moving away from presentation documents opens the opportunity to re-think storage, navigation and distribution.

I found more and more that presentation software wasn't letting me do what I imagined. I couldn't ever create something that met my standards. This is what drove me to convince those around me to begin moving from Powerpoint-based classes to HTML 'mini-site' classes. More on that soon, but for now I think it's an invaluable, albeit scary, first step. It's like opening night. There's a lot of potential and a lot of risk on the table, but I'm confident it's going to go great.

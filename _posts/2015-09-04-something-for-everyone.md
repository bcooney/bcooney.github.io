Staff doodles on a coffee cup at a Starbucks in Chengdu, China

One thing Starbucks does well in China, that I don't think they especially do well in the US, is that they have something for everyone. Everything can be tailored here -- half ice, half-shot, double-whip, etc... When I see things like this I'm reminded of the baseline expectations that people have for service and how, in order to earn confidence and trust, a company must consistently reach for new ideas that push beyond that baseline. Front-line service staff are the source of all the best creativity because creativity comes from trust. Without teams that trusts each other, how should a customer trust a company?

# Google Freud

---

I just found an old comment I made on HN where I was confused and misread "Google Feud" as "Google *Freud.*" From the original post, I imagined that this would be an extension to Chrome which would add psycho-analytical analysis and judgment to search results. For example:

> Search: Is calorie counting actually useful?
> Result: Does Counting Calories Actually Count? [nutrition.org]
> Freud: Being entirely honest with oneself is a good exercise.

This was nearly a year ago, but I still this this is a good idea. I'll report back on my progress creating this extension. It might be easiest doing it in javascript via Greasemonkey. We'll see.

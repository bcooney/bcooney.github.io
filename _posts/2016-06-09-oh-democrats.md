--- [misyo](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4n8gwp/fbi_admits_finding_additional_info_on_clinton/d41ws5n) on Reddit, responding to FBI admission that additional information had been found on the Clinton email server. Great soundbite, fully captures the sentiment right now. I usually don't get my news from ["newz"](http://lawnewz.com/high-profile/fbi-admits-finding-additional-info-on-clinton-server-during-e-mail-investigation/)
 sites, but this one has the FBI filing via Scribd.
